    <p>My favorite game is Grow a Garden on Roblox. I know it’s about plants, but it’s actually really fun. You get to plant things, take care of them, and build your own garden with tools and sprinklers. It feels nice watching everything grow. My favorite food is Western food, like burgers, fries, pizza, and all that tasty stuff that makes you full and happy. My favorite drink is just water. It’s kinda plain, not super interesting, but I like it because it’s good for you and I drink it all the time.</p>

        <p class="RamenParagraf">RAMEN <br> Ramen tastes super yummy! The noodles are soft and chewy, and the soup is warm, salty, and full of flavor. The meat is juicy, and the green onions add a little crunch. It’s so good that I want more from others!</p>

    <div class="Tea2">
        <p class="TeaParagraf">TEA <br>Tea tastes warm and cozy with a little bit of flavor, like flowers or leaves. It can be sweet if you add sugar, or a little bitter if it’s plain. When you drink it, it feels calm and relaxing, like a quiet moment in a cup</p>

It’s exciting, and every hit feels like a little challenge. Scoring a point feels really awesome. and i did not get the ball hit on my face (its the opposite)</p>

        <p class="BikeParagraf">CYCLING <br> Riding a bike is super fun and makes you feel free. You can go fast, feel the wind, and explore places. It’s good exercise and also exciting, especially when going down a hill. Balancing, pedaling, and turning all make it an adventure!</p>
